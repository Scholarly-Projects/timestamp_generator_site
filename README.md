# timestamp_generator_site

This site was created so student workers can easily copy time codes to enrich oral history transcripts. Students can access the page, drop their audio or visual files in and every time the user pauses the media, that time stamp is generated in a box below, which can be copied to their clipboard by select a button to the right. Created for enhancing legacy transcripts from the Rural Women's History Project, so they can be utilized in the CDIL's Oral History as Data platform. _Andrew Weymouth_, Fall, 2025.
